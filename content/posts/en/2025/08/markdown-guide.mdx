> This post demonstrates how to write with Markdown/MDX in this blog. When saving or publishing, the system auto-creates directories by year/month and uses Asia/Shanghai timestamps.

## 1. Headings

Use `#` to `######` for H1–H6:

```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

## 2. Emphasis

- Italic: `*text*` or `_text_` → *text*
- Bold: `**text**` or `__text__` → **text**
- Strikethrough: `~~text~~` → ~~text~~
- Inline code: `` `code` `` → `code`

## 3. Paragraphs & Line Breaks

Leave a blank line to start a new paragraph. Add two spaces at line end or use `<br />` for a hard break.

## 4. Lists

- Unordered: `-` / `*` / `+`
- Ordered: `1.`, `2.`, … (auto increments)

```md
- Item A
- Item B
  - Subitem B1

1. Step one
2. Step two
```

## 5. Blockquotes

Use `>`:

```md
> A quote paragraph.
>> Nested quote.
```

## 6. Links & Images

- Link: `[text](https://example.com)`
- Image: `![alt](/images/example.png)` (Recommended to put assets under `public/` like `public/images/...`)

```md
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

![Example](/images/example.png)
```

## 7. Code

- Inline code: surround with backticks `` `code` ``
- Code blocks: triple backticks plus a language (Shiki highlighting is enabled)

```ts
export function hello(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

```bash
# CLI example
npm run dev
```

## 8. Tables

```md
| Feature | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Italic | *text* | *text* |
| Bold | **text** | **text** |
| Inline code | `code` | `code` |
```

| Feature | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Italic | `*text*` | *text* |
| Bold | `**text**` | **text** |
| Inline code | `` `code` `` | `code` |

## 9. Thematic Break

Use three or more `-`, `*`, or `_` on a single line:

---

## 10. Task List

```md
- [x] Done
- [ ] Todo
```

- [x] Done
- [ ] Todo

## 11. Tips / Admonitions

The project doesn’t ship a dedicated admonition syntax, but you can mimic it with blockquotes + bold text:

> **Tip**: When publishing/saving drafts via Admin, you only fill a short slug; the system auto-prefixes `YYYY/MM/`.

## 12. MDX Notes

- MDX is supported; you can embed React components when needed.
- If a component is interactive, mark it as a client component with `"use client"` and import/use carefully in MDX.
- For most posts, plain Markdown is sufficient to keep content simple and maintainable.

## 13. Frontmatter

Put YAML at the top as metadata:

```md
---
title: Title
summary: Summary
tags: [tag1, tag2]
publishedAt: 2025-08-10 21:14:36
updatedAt: 2025-08-10 21:14:36
draft: false
---
```

- `publishedAt`/`updatedAt`: Use Asia/Shanghai full datetime `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` consistently.
- `draft`: set `true` for drafts; after publishing, it should be `false`.
- Slug: in Admin, only fill a short slug (lowercase letters/numbers/hyphen). The system auto-adds `YYYY/MM/` directories.

## 14. Preview & Publish

- In Admin, you can first save as a draft. The list supports refresh and one-click publish.
- After publishing, you’ll be redirected to the post page: `/en/blog/YYYY/MM/slug` (Chinese is `/blog/YYYY/MM/slug`).
